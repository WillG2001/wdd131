        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The Reviewer's Scrolls is a site where I compile my reviews for various pieces of media, similar
            to social review platforms such as Letterboxd. It's a place where enjoyers of media can read
            about my opinions on movies, TV shows, and video games I've checked out recently, and see if
            they're something they should check out as well.

        <p>Welcome to the Reviewer’s Scrolls! My name is Will, and here you can find a collection of my thoughts
            on various video games, TV shows, and movies I’ve played/watched recently. Some are new, some are classics.
            These are just my opinions, so feel free to disagree or agree.</p>
        <h4>Video Game Reviews</h4>

        <img src="images/dkb.png" alt="Donkey Kong Bananza box art" />
        <h5>Donkey Kong Bananza (2025)</h5>
        <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is the latest entry in the classic Donkey Kong franchise for the Nintendo Switch 2. And
            boy, is it a winner! Fans of Super Mario Odyssey will notice vast similarities between the two games. But
            Bananza is more than just Odyssey with a DK skin. It’s full of new mechanics and is truly a Donkey Kong game
            at heart. The main mechanic is that DK can punch and smash his way through just about any surface in the
            game. This leads to all sorts of fun exploration and secrets to find. It’s an absolute joy to find bananas,
            fossils, and other collectibles! Bananas lead to unlocking new skills for DK, so there’s a purpose to
            exploration. Combine that with some excellent platforming and a heartwarming story thanks to the inclusion
            of young Pauline, and you have a game that’s truly special. I honestly can’t find anything really wrong with
            it, and it’s hard to put it down! And I won’t spoil the ending sequence, but it’s some of the most fun I’ve
            had with a game in a long time.</p>

        <img src="images/mkw.png" alt="Mario Kart World box art" />
        <h5>Mario Kart World (2025)</h5>
        <p>Mario Kart World is the next entry in the Mario Kart series, released as a launch title for Nintendo’s new
            console, the Switch 2. I did a full review on my YouTube channel, but here is a summary of my thoughts.
            Overall, I really enjoy this game. I hesitate to say it’s the best Mario Kart game ever made, but after
            logging over 100 hours over the past several months, I can safely say it’s one of my personal favorites. It
            offers a lot of content with its open-world structure and “Free Roam” mode, and the individual tracks are
            really well-designed. The “intermission” tracks are more controversial due to their mostly straightforward
            nature, but I found that these offered a unique racing experience, different from the classic “3-lap”
            tracks. Online play is chaotic as ever and will test your skills, especially in the wonderful new “Knockout
            Tour” mode. It’s a great next step from the classic Mario Kart formula, and it makes me excited about the
            series’ future.</p>

        <img src="images/sm64.png" alt="Super Mario 64 box art" />
        <h5>Super Mario 64 (1996)</h5>
        <p>I recently beat Super Mario 64, a true Nintendo 64 classic, for the first time on Nintendo Classics on the
            Switch, after many years of playing it on the Wii’s Virtual Console. Super Mario 64 is the game that set the
            stage for many three-dimensional games to come afterward. It still holds up well today, although certain
            things are a bit outdated, such as the game’s camera and how Mario controls. But it’s an absolute joy to
            explore the painting worlds of Peach’s castle and hunt down Stars. In many ways, this game was the first of
            its kind, and spawned a whole genre of “collectathon” 3D platformers. And for that, this game will always
            have my respect. I hope to one day 100% complete this game by collecting all 120 Stars!

        <img src="images/metroid-fusion.jpg" alt="Metroid Fusion box art" />
        <h5>Metroid Fusion (2002)</h5>
        <p>Originally released on the Game Boy Advance, Metroid Fusion is the fourth game in the mainline Metroid
            series, and it’s a personal favorite of mine. I recently replayed it on the Switch’s Nintendo Classics. The
            game follows Samus exploring the BSL Research Station in order to neutralize a threat to the galaxy known as
            the X Parasites. Whereas Super Metroid, the SNES prequel to this game, had a more open-ended structure, this
            game follows a more linear mission-based structure. However, there’s still a lot you need to figure out on
            your own, especially in the later parts of the game, so it still feels like a true Metroid experience.
            Finding upgrades for Samus to get stronger and access new areas as the game progresses still feels great,
            and there’s plenty of challenge to be had, especially with the game’s bosses. The atmosphere is great too,
            with a sense of fear permeating throughout the game as you’re hunted by your evil clone, the SA-X. I’d
            highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Metroidvanias and action games in general.</p>

        <img src="images/snes_yoshis_island.jpg" alt="Yoshi's Island box art" />
        <h5>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island (1995)</h5>
        <p>I recently beat Yoshi’s Island on the Nintendo Classics on the Switch. I’m a fan of the first Super Mario
            World, and always wanted to play this game. It’s less of a sequel to Super Mario World and more of its own
            thing, but that isn’t a bad thing! It’s still one of the more fun 2D platformers I’ve played. Yoshi is super
            fun to control, and making and throwing eggs is a great mechanic. The concept of having to carry around Baby
            Mario is a good one. I like how damage is handled in this game: when Yoshi takes a hit, Baby Mario goes into
            a bubble and you have to retrieve him before a timer expires. I also really like the game’s art style:
            everything looks like it could have been hand-drawn with crayons! It’s also a challenging game, especially
            if you try to go for a perfect 100 score on each level. Overall, this game is a classic and I’d recommend it
            to anyone that enjoys a challenging platformer and hasn’t played this one.</p>

        <img src="images/balatro.jpg" alt="Balatro logo" />
        <h5>Balatro (2024)</h5>
        <p>A poker rogue-like. It might sound like a weird idea on paper, but once you try Balatro, you won’t want to
            put it down! I played the Nintendo Switch version of Balatro and had a blast with it. It’s easy to pick up
            but difficult to master! The game revolves around you trying to construct the best poker hand you can to
            score points. You need a certain number of points in a set number of hands to beat the “blind” you’re up
            against and advance to the next one, and as you make your way through the antes, it gets more challenging.
            There are all sorts of special cards and Jokers you can obtain that make the game even more interesting.
            It’s so satisfying to have the right combination of special cards to rack up a ton of points! I’d recommend
            Balatro to anyone that enjoys card games and rogue-likes!</p>

        <img src="images/m-and-l-bs.jpg" alt="Mario & Luigi: Brothership box art" />
        <h5>Mario & Luigi: Brothership (2024)</h5>
        <p>Mario & Luigi: Brothership is the sixth entry in the beloved Mario & Luigi spinoff series of RPGs, released
            on Nintendo Switch. The game stars the iconic brothers exploring the new land of Concordia on a quest to
            discover and reconnect the scattered islands on the map. It has that charm we’ve come to love from the
            series, and a great battling system that was a highlight for me. Traveling the seas on Shipshape Island and
            discovering new islands is a great concept that works well for a Mario & Luigi game. The game definitely has
            some pacing issues, as it takes a while to really get started, but once it does, you’re in for a treat. It’s
            a long game that took me 50 hours to complete (granted, I did all of the sidequests as well), but as someone
            that enjoys games that I can’t complete in one sitting, and encourage me to take my time, the length wasn’t
            really a problem for me. It’s got great writing and humor as always, and a particular plot twist I won’t
            spoil that makes for one of the most unhinged endings to a Nintendo game I’ve seen, and perhaps the best
            Mario villain since Super Paper Mario. If you like longer games and are a fan of the series, you’ll probably
            like Brothership a lot.</p>

        <h4>TV Show Reviews</h4>

        <img src="images/Stranger-Things-Poster.jpeg" alt="Stranger Things poster" />
        <h5>Stranger Things (2016-2025)</h5>
        <p>Netflix’s Stranger Things became a cultural phenomenon the likes of which I haven’t really seen with most TV
            shows. Set in the 1980s, the show follows a group of middle-schoolers and high-schoolers as they
            investigate, well, strange things happening in their small town of Hawkins, Indiana. The disappearance of
            Will Byers begins an epic adventure full of creepy monsters, government conspiracies, and even the
            involvement of Russian scientists and armies. Packed with 80s pop-culture references and parallels to
            Dungeons & Dragons, and a great sense of mystery and suspense throughout the whole show, it’s no wonder the
            show became an instant classic, especially Season 1. It’s got great character development, and the
            characters play really well off of each other’s strengths and weaknesses. The designs of monsters such as
            the Demogorgon and the Mind Flayer, and the Upside Down (a dark parallel version of Hawkins) are really
            cool. The inclusion of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers, is fantastic, and she makes for a great hero
            of the story. I look forward to the conclusion of this amazing series with Season 5. If the show continues
            its path of greatness, the final battle between the heroes and the evil Vecna with his forces of the Upside
            Down will be legendary. If you haven’t watched Stranger Things, I would highly recommend it, as long as you
            don’t mind some elements of fear.</p>
        <p>Rating: 9</p>

        <img src="images/lost-poster.jpg" alt="Lost poster" />
        <h5>Lost (2004-2010)</h5>
        <p>ABC’s Lost is an interesting show. It starts out as a classic survival story when the passengers of Oceanic
            Flight 815 crash-land on a mysterious, uncharted island. However, the story quickly twists and turns with
            the inclusion of things such as a monster made of black smoke, the discovery of underground hatches built by
            a mysterious organization called the “Dharma Initiative”, and a group of island natives known as “The
            Others” that begin to terrorize and kidnap the Flight 815 passengers. The show raises a lot of questions
            almost every episode, and not all of them get answered. That can be frustrating at times, but it leaves a
            lot to your imagination, which is cool. The episodes also follow a really interesting structure with
            flashback scenes about a character’s life before the crash, interspersed with the happenings on the island.
            Overall, Lost is a very unique show that I’m glad I finally got to watch. While it can be confusing and hard
            to follow sometimes, it still has some of the best scenes in television I’ve seen, which is why I recommend
            it.</p>
        <p>Rating: 7</p>

        <img src="images/psych.jpg" alt="Psych poster" />
        <h5>Psych (2006-2014)</h5>
        <p>USA Network’s Psych is a hilarious show that I absolutely loved every minute of. I can’t believe I haven’t
            watched it until this year! It may have surpassed The Office as my favorite comedy show, which is saying a
            lot. The show follows an extremely observant guy named Shawn and his best friend Gus as they work cases for
            the Santa Barbara Police Department. The catch is an absurd one but it somehow works great: Shawn is
            pretending to be psychic, which leads to all sorts of crazy antics. The show’s humor is one of its greatest
            strengths: Shawn and Gus are a great comedic duo that play off of each other perfectly, and some of the
            scenarios they find themselves in are downright ridiculous and hilarious. But it’s the show’s heart that
            really hooked me, and the relationships between the characters are the driving force behind everything. In
            my opinion, it’s just about the perfect show. I wholeheartedly recommend it!</p>

        <h4>Movie Reviews</h4>

        <img src="images/Interstellar_film_poster.jpg" alt="Interstellar poster" />
        <h5>Interstellar (2014)</h5>
        <p>Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar is a special film. It follows a group of astronauts who embark on an epic
            mission to find a new home for Earth’s inhabitants who are suffering from famine and dust storms. The movie
            features spectacular cinematography with breathtaking scenes, especially during space travel and when the
            astronauts are exploring new planets. The narrative is emotionally compelling as well, with an emphasis on
            the family of Joseph Cooper, the main character (played by Matthew McConaughey). Top it off with excellent
            sound design, and a fantastic
            score by Hans Zimmer, and you have a cinematic masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Rating: 10</p>

        <img src="images/La_La_Land_(film).png" alt="La La Land poster" />
        <h5>La La Land (2016)</h5>
        <p>I’m a fan of musicals, and La La Land is a great example of how to do a musical comedy-drama right. Starring
            Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the film follows an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist as they meet, fall in
            love, and pursue their dreams together. The screenplay is wonderful and quite entertaining. The music is
            very good as well, with great choreography to go along with it. One particular standout to me is the piano
            theme heard throughout the film that symbolizes Mia and Seb’s relationship. Overall, I really enjoyed La La
            Land, and if you like musicals, you probably will too!</p>
        <p>Rating: 8</p>

        <img src="images/Superman_(2025_film)_poster.jpg" alt="Superman poster" />
        <h5>Superman (2025)</h5>
        <p>In a day and age where superhero movies are everywhere, James Gunn manages to deliver a reboot of a beloved
            superhero franchise that earnestly begins a new era of DC films and stands out in a sea of comic book
            movies. It features excellent performances by David Corenswet as Clark Kent/Superman, Nicholas Hoult as Lex
            Luthor, and others as well. The film follows Superman as he aims to win back public support after his
            intervention in an international conflict orchestrated by Lex Luthor, all the while, learning about his
            purpose and who he truly is. It’s a movie about the value of humanity and offers a refreshing take on a
            classic character. I was greatly surprised by it and would definitely recommend it to comic book fans and
            moviegoers alike!</p>

        <img src="images/The_Fantastic_Four_First_Steps_poster.jpg" alt="The Fantastic Four: First Steps poster" />
        <h5>The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)</h5>
        <p>I was a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe during the Infinity Saga, and gradually began to lose
            interest in the overall MCU as time went on and quality of films and shows began to vary wildly. However,
            there have been some standout films in recent years, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the most recent
            MCU entry at the time of this review, is a solid example of one. It’s the second reboot of the Fantastic
            Four film series, and as someone that doesn’t have much attachment to the franchise, I found it quite
            enjoyable and a good return to form for the MCU. It follows the titular team led by Reed Richards (Pedro
            Pascal) as they fight to protect Earth from Galactus. It’s a strong narrative about the power of family and
            humanity, and features a unique retro-futuristic 1960s style. It was a fun time and I’d recommend it for
            anyone who’s been feeling disconnected from the MCU lately like me.</p>

        <h3>Page 2 - About my rating scale</h3>

        <p>The grading system, at least here in the US, doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. You’re telling me that
            something 75% correct constitutes an “average” grade? Maybe it works for school assignments, but for media,
            I
            use a different scale: a simple, 10 point system where each point value summarizes how I feel about a piece
            of
            media. In my system, a 5 is an average score, right in the middle of the scale. Here’s a breakdown of what
            each
            point value represents:</p>

        <p>10 - just about perfect in every way. Pieces of media that score a ten are few and far between, and have
            little
            to no flaws whatsoever. Tens are not only excellent, but special. These pieces of media make me feel
            something
            beyond just “this is pretty cool”. They make me think, they make me feel a range of emotions, and they make
            me
            want to share them with the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>9 - Outstanding. An excellent piece of media with a few flaws.</p>

        <p>8 - Great! More flawed than a nine, but still a very enjoyable experience.</p>

        <p>7 - Solid. Something that’s good in most aspects, with a few issues here and there.</p>

        <p>6 - OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. A somewhat flawed piece of media.</p>

        <p>5 - Average. A piece of media that isn’t bad, per se, but also doesn’t have much going for it.</p>

        <p>4 - Meh… slightly below average. A lot of flaws and nothing special.</p>

        <p>3 - Subpar. A very flawed piece of media that isn’t very enjoyable.</p>

        <p>2 - Bad. Way too many mistakes were made when making this piece of media, but at least they tried. Just not
            something really worth spending time with.</p>

        <p>1 - Atrocious. Not only is it bad, but it’s offensively bad. It’s like they didn’t even try, or were
            intentionally trying to create a monster. The only thing separating this from a zero is that it can indeed
            be
            considered art, even if it absolutely stinks.</p>

        <p>0 - Worthless. Never, EVER, under ANY circumstances, consume this piece of media. This score is reserved only
            for media that is intentionally offensive, extremely inappropriate, or was made unethically. Zeroes
            shouldn’t
            even be considered art in my opinion. Nothing I’ll ever bother to write a review for will score a zero.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
            here
        </p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            Images will be responsive and display on top of the review below the title in desktop view. Upon loading the
            page, the welcome message will display instead of reviews, until you sort by category or search for a
            review.

        <h3>Page 2 - About my rating scale</h3>
        <p>
            The second page is pretty simple. It just displays the rating scale information.
