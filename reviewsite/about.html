        <h1>About my rating scale</h1>

        <p>The grading system, at least here in the US, doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. You’re telling me that
            something 75% correct constitutes an “average” grade? Maybe it works for school assignments, but for media,
            I
            use a different scale: a simple, 10 point system where each point value summarizes how I feel about a piece
            of
            media. In my system, a 5 is an average score, right in the middle of the scale. Here’s a breakdown of what
            each
            point value represents.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <p>10 - Just about perfect in every way. Pieces of media that score a ten are few and far between, and have
        little
        to no flaws whatsoever. Tens are not only excellent, but special. These pieces of media make me feel
        something
        beyond just “this is pretty cool”. They make me think, they make me feel a range of emotions, and they make
        me
        want to share them with the rest of the world.</p>

    <p>9 - Outstanding. An excellent piece of media with a few flaws.</p>

    <p>8 - Great! More flawed than a nine, but still a very enjoyable experience.</p>

    <p>7 - Solid. Something that’s good in most aspects, with a few issues here and there.</p>

    <p>6 - OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. A somewhat flawed piece of media.</p>

    <p>5 - Average. A piece of media that isn’t bad, per se, but also doesn’t have much going for it.</p>

    <p>4 - Meh… slightly below average. A lot of flaws and nothing special.</p>

    <p>3 - Subpar. A very flawed piece of media that isn’t very enjoyable.</p>

    <p>2 - Bad. Way too many mistakes were made when making this piece of media, but at least they tried. Just not
        something really worth spending time with.</p>

    <p>1 - Atrocious. Not only is it bad, but it’s offensively bad. It’s like they didn’t even try, or were
        intentionally trying to create a monster. The only thing separating this from a zero is that it can indeed
        be
        considered art, even if it absolutely stinks.</p>

    <p>0 - Worthless. Never, EVER, under ANY circumstances, consume this piece of media. This score is reserved only
        for media that is intentionally offensive, extremely inappropriate, or was made unethically. Zeroes
        shouldn’t
        even be considered art in my opinion. Nothing I’ll ever bother to write a review for will score a zero.</p>
